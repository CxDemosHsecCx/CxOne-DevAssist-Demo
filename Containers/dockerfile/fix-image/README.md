# Dockerfile

This Dockerfile contains several intentional vulnerabilities for security testing:

1. **~~Using latest tag~~ REMEDIATED** ~~(Low Severity)~~ - ~~Using the `latest` tag for base images can cause unexpected behavior and inconsistent builds.~~ **FIXED: Updated to `node:24.4.1-alpine` for security and consistency.**

2. **~~Using vulnerable base image~~ REMEDIATED** ~~(Critical Severity)~~ - ~~Using `debian:10` with known CVEs.~~ **FIXED: Updated to `debian:bookworm-20220125` with zero known CVEs.**

3. **~~Using vulnerable Drupal base image~~ REMEDIATED** ~~(Critical Severity)~~ - ~~Using `drupal:10.1.8-php8.2-fpm-alpine3.20` with critical CVEs.~~ **FIXED: Updated to `drupal:11.2.0-php8.3-fpm-alpine3.21` with highest security rating.**

4. **Running with root privileges** (Medium Severity) - The container runs as root, which is a security risk.

5. **Using --force flag with npm install** (Low Severity) - Forces installation regardless of conflicts.

6. **Exposing unnecessary ports** (Low Severity) - More ports than needed are exposed.

7. **Running with full privileges** (Medium Severity) - No security options are specified to limit container privileges.
